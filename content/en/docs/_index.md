Welcome to the Odigos user guide! This guide shows you how to get started sending telemetry data such as traces, metrics and logs using Odigos.

Odigos allows developers to focus on writing applications by automatically extracting metrics and distributed traces from their code.

Be prepared for the next production issue with the best observability tools, without the
overhead of instrumenting your code or taking care of collector agents.

The name Odigos originates from Greek, meaning guide.

## Odigos in Short

|                                      |                                                                                                                                               |

| **üßë‚Äçüíª Automatic instrumentation**     | Odigos detects the programming language of your applications and apply automatic instrumentation accordingly..                                |
| **üìñ Open Technologies**             | Observability pipelines created by Odigos are based on popular, battle tested, open source technologies. Specificlly, OpenTelemetry and eBPF. |
| **‚öñÔ∏è Scales with your data**         | Odigos scales the number of collectors based on the traffic of your applications. No need to manage complex collectors topology               |
| **üìà No learning curve**             | Use advanced features like tail-based sampling without complex YAML configurations                                                            |
| **‚úÖ Best practices out of the box** | API key are saved as Kubernetes secrets, minimal collector images contains only relevant exporters and many more                              |
| **‚ò∏Ô∏è Cloud Native**                  | Odigos is specially designed to instrument containers deployed in Kubernetes. Providing a natural experience to Kubernetes users.             |

## Who is Odigos for?

**Application developers** - focus on writing code. Odigos takes care of producing metrics ands traces for any open source library in use, without any code changes.

**DevOps engineers** - Stop wasting time deploying and configuring collectors. Odigos automatically deploys and scales collectors for you, according to the current traffic of your applications.
